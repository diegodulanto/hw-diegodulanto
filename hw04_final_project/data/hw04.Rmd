## Renaming columns

# WDG: Check out the rename() function (more readable). Also, colnames() is a list of the column names. You can just assign a vector of values instead of doing element-wise change like you're doing
# Example:
# colnames(immigrant_data) <- c("month_of_admissions" ...)

# Also, using space as delimiters is usually not as friendly as using "_" underscores.


colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V1"] <- "Month of Admission"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V2"] <- "Year of Admission"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V3"] <- "Country of Birth"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V4"] <- "Age"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V5"] <- "Country of Last Permanent Residence"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V6"] <- "Marital Status"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V7"] <- "State of Intended Residence"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V8"] <- "Metropolitan Area of Intended Residence"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V9"] <- "Labor Certification"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V10"] <- "Occupation"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V11"] <- "Sex"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V12"] <- "Country of Chargeability"
colnames(immigrant_data)[colnames(immigrant_data) == "V13"] <- "Type of Case"

# Structuring Data
