								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This data collection contains information on the
characteristics of aliens who became legal permanent residents of the
United States in fiscal year 2000 (October 1999 through September
2000). Data are presented for two types of immigrants. The first
category, New Arrivals, arrived from outside the United States with
valid immigration visas issued by the United States Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The second category, Adjustments, were already
in the United States with temporary status and were adjusted to legal
permanent residence through petition to the United States Immigration
and Naturalization Service. Variables include port of entry, month and
year of admission, class of admission, and state and area to which the
immigrants were admitted. Demographic information such as age, sex,
marital status, occupation, country of birth, country of last
permanent residence, and nationality is also provided.</span></p>
