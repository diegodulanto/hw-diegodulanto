#### Greetings! This is the main location where you can find all my data programming work!

## About Me

**My name is Diego Dulanto:**

1. I am a Junior-year transfer student from Hillsborough Community College. I am majoring in Psychology, and plan to study Clinical Psychology in grad school. :school:

2. I am also a DACA recipient. I am originally from Lima, Peru.

3. I have two Shih Tzus, Bubba and Holly. :dog:
    * Bubba is nine years old
    * Holly is four years old \(I recently adopted Holly from the Humane Society\)

4. I am hoping to one day do research on mental health disparities in minority communities and own a private practice in a low-income community to close the mental health gap. 

**_It is a pleasure to meet you!_** :relaxed:
